## Projects

### Resident Evil Website (IN DEVELOPMENT) 
Speedrunning website designed and created in HTML/CSS/JS, as well as photoshop to record speedruns for various Resident Evil Games. Users will be able to view and submit videos, have logins to claim ownership of submitted runs, and will be put on leaderboard for how fast they were in a certain game and speedrun category.

### For Fun Projects
I do some for fun editing projects in Adobe Premiere and after effects, mainly for content creators on twitch. Note: Some gifs will be lower quality than actual output due to size restraints.
